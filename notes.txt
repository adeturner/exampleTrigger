Message ingestion and delivery are priced per volume of data transmitted in a calendar month. 
The first 10 gigabytes of usage are free. After that, the price for ingestion or delivery of messages is $40 per TiB.
Ingestion and delivery charges apply only to publish requests and data delivered using pull, streamingPull or push operations. Other operations are free.


A message storage policy can result in additional region egress (network) fees if the policy forces the data
to exit a Google Cloud region. Consider a message that is:

Published in region A
Routed to region B for storage
Delivered to a subscriber client in region C

In this case:
The project that contains the topic is billed for network egress from region A to region B.
The project that contains the subscription is billed for egress from region B to region C.
